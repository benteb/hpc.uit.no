to talk to.

{{ enddiv() }}

## About the group

We are part of the [Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services
(NRIS)](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).  Within [UiT](https://uit.no/) we
are part of the [faggruppa for forsknings og
formidlingstjenester](https://uit.no/enhet/ita/digitaleforskningsogformidlingstjenester).

We have in-house expertise in operating clusters and networks with hundreds of
nodes, thousands of cores, and petabytes of data.  We have experts in software
installation, code performance optimization, CPU and GPU programming, and
[research software engineering](https://research-software.uit.no/).
