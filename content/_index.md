# High-performance computing group at [UiT](https://uit.no/)

When your computation does not fit anymore into your computer, we are the group
to talk to.

{{ enddiv() }}

## About the group

We are part of the [Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services
(NRIS)](https://documentation.sigma2.no/).  Within [UiT](https://uit.no/) we
are part of the [faggruppa for forsknings og
formidlingstjenester](https://uit.no/enhet/ita/digitaleforskningsogformidlingstjenester).

We have in-house expertise in operating clusters and networks with hundreds of
nodes, thousands of cores, and petabytes of data.  We have experts in software
installation, code performance optimization, CPU and GPU programming, and
[research software engineering](https://research-software.uit.no/).

[Here](/team/) you can meet the team.


## Our goals

- Improve the usability of the NRIS services.
- Help improving your scripts and codes and workflows so that you get more research done in less time.
- [Provide training](/training/) to give everybody the tools they need and confidence to use the tools.
